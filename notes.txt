Monolithic app.
- running as a single process spread across a handful of servers.
- slow release cycles.
- "package up the whole system" and deploy.
- components "tightly coupled together" and have to be developed, deployed, and manged "as one entity".
- can't scale components individually.

Vertical Scaling
- by adding more CPUs, memory to a server.

Horizontal Scaling
- by adding additional servers (replicas)

Microservices. (ms)
- monolithic app being broken down into components (microservices)
- decoupled from each other.
- developed, deployed, updated and scaled individually.
- bigger numbers of components hard to configure, manage, and keep.
- talk through HTTP (sync) or AMQP (async) or IPC

Divergence of environment (배포 환경 차이의 증가)
- 마이크로서비스는 독립적이기 때문에 필요한 의존 라이브러리를 자유롭게 결정.
- 문제는 "하나의 노드"에 여러 마이크로서비스를 배포시 중복 라이브러리로 의해 작업 복잡성 증가.
- The bigger the number of components need to deploy on the same node, the harder it will be to manage all deps.

DevOps
- a team develops and deploying and taking care of the app.

Container Technologies. (Docker, rkt)
- to provide "isolation apps" (env, deps, network, filesystem) instead of vm.
- achieve by using linux namespace & cgroup

    Linux namespaces.
    - makes sure each process sees its own "personal view" of the system.
    - mnt
    - pid   (process id)
    - net   (network)
    - ipc   (inter-process communication)
    - user
        
Kube (Kubernetes)
- a platform that allows you to deploy and manage containerized apps.
- run apps on one or more nodes.
- provides service discovering, scaling, load-balancing, self-healing and leader election (master-slave model). 
- abstract away the underlying infrastructure and expose whole data-center as a single computational resource (cluster).
- composed of a master node and one or more worker nodes.

Kube architecture.
    Hardware level.
        Master Node
        - hosts the "Kube Control Plane" which controls and manage the whole kube system.
        - composed of etcd, Kube Api Server, Scheduler, Controller Manager
            
        Worker Node
        - run the actual app you deploy (by "kubelet")
        - composed of "kubelet", "kube-proxy", "container runtime (docker)"
        
Kube Master Components
    Kube Control Plane
    - controls the kube cluster and makes it function.
    - composed of etcd, Kube Api Server, Scheduler, Controller Manager
    
    Kube Api Server (KAS)
    - an entry point allow client and other components in the Control Plan communicate with.
    
    Scheduler
    - schedules apps to supervision ("assign a worker node" to deployable components of your app)
    - "scheduling" means assigning the pod to a node.
    
    Controller Manager.
    - performs cluster-level functions. (keeps replica, track of worker nodes, handling node failures)

    etcd
    - a distributed key-value data store that stores the cluster configuration (resource manifests).

Kube Worker Node Components.
    Container Runtime
    - runs you containers.
    
    Kubelet
    - talk with API server and manages containers on that node.
    
    kube-proxy
    - load-balances network traffic btw app components.

Docker 
- a platform for packaging, distributing, and running containerized apps.
- make containers "portable" across different nodes.

    Docker components.
    - Images
        - something you package the app and its env into.
        - container images are composed of layers that can be shared among different images.
        - docker run
        - docker build
        - docker ps, images
        
    - Registries
        - place to store your images and share with other developer.
        
    - Containers
        - regular linux container (process) created from your image.
        - isolated from the node and all other processes.
        - using its own PID Linux namespace. (completely isolated process  tree)
        - has an isolated filesystem.
        
kubectl
- interact with the kube through the "kubectl cli client".
- issues REST requests to the Kube API server on the master node.

Pods
- a group of tightly related containers on the same worker node and in the same Linux namespace.
- a logical machine which owns IP, hostname, processes.
- Pods are spread out across different worker nodes. (flat network)
- basic building block in kube.
- pods are ephemeral. (can disappear at any time)

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: [podName]
  labels:
    [pod's label]
spec:
  containers:
    - name: [ctName]
      image: [img]
      ports:
        - containerPort: [ctPort]
          protocol: TCP
  
    Sequence of deploying a pod 
    1. developer build & push the img
    2. developer issues pod's manifest to KAS through "kubectl"
    3. Scheduler notified the event and schedule the pod to a node.
    4. kubelet is notified and run the img through "Container Runtime" on the node.

ReplicationController
- replicate pods and keep the number of replica.

Service.
- an entrypoint which gets a static IP for multiple pods or rc.
- redirect & load balancing client requests to the pods.
